# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? I understand the concept in general but applying it in different scenarios was difficult to do. I am not confident in my fluency of it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? I felt a lot of pressure due to the time constraints that I had. Overall once I was able to understand the concepts and apply them things went well. I experience both productive and unproductive struggles with this assignment.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Yes I do, I will continue to review the material we have and practice. It has been difficult to have additional time outside of work and school/homework to work on extra studying.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I don't have specific questions, just needing a lot more practice.
